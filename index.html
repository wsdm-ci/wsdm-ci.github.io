    <p>I just want to say that when he told me that he had started learning to code, I was so shocked yet so happy, shocked because I never expected the halfwit to start learning (lol) and happy beacuse he was making good use of his time, finally seeing the light and coming into the coding world.</p>
    <p>I feel like everyone living in the 21st century should have coding in their skill set.</p>

  <h3 class="post-title">Becoming a web developer</h3>
  <div class="post-content">
    <p>If someone would have told me some weeks ago that 'me' was going to be able to even attempt to make a <strong>website</strong>, I would not have believed them but here we are!</p>
    <p>Just some days later, I stumbled on an interesting ad about an app called <a href="https://getmimo.com">Mimo</a>, it wasn't just attractive, it looked interesting and like something I had been searching for. I got the app and got to learning, I haven't been so excited to do something, like this, in a while â€” working on a <em>real</em> blog.  </p>
